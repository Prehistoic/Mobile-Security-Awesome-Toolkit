1. **Download:** Navigate to the official Android Developers website and download the latest version of Android Studio for your operating system.

2. **Run Installer:**
   - **Windows/macOS:** Double-click the downloaded executable file. Follow the prompts in the setup wizard. It's usually safe to accept the default configuration settings.
